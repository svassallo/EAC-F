                <p>
                    From 1868, when the membership of the University’s General Council was
                    expanded to include all graduates of the University, the General Council
                    handled communications with alumni, including balloting them for the
                    election of the Chancellor. In 1990, the Development Campaign Office was
                    established to co-ordinate the University's newly launched development
                    campaign and to communicate with alumni regarding fund raising. In about
                    1998, the Development and Alumni Office was established to perform both
                    these functions. Within the Development and Alumni Office, the Alumni
                    Relations Officer was responsible for dealing with queries from and about
                    alumni and ensuring that good relations were maintained between the
                    University and its alumni, and the Development Campaign Officer was
                    responsible for fostering links with alumni and raising funds on behalf of the
                    University.

                    In 1948, the Glasgow University Graduates Association was formed to
                    maintain closer contact between the University and its graduates. It published
                    a magazine, known as the College Courant, which included reminiscences,
                    histories, obituaries and articles concerning education and other topics and
                    became the main means of communication between the graduates. The
                    Glasgow University Graduates Association ceased to exist in 1985 but the
                    University agreed to continue with the publication of a magazine for
                    graduates. Accordingly, from 1987, it published a free, twice-yearly
                    magazine for alumni and friends of the University, known as Avenue.
